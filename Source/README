This is the redistributable version of the MCMC code, with the compilation procedure

./configure
make
sudo make install

on Mac and Linux systems. Note that you must have GSL, CCFits, and cfitsio installed for configure to complete; it will tell you the first of these which is missing and promptly exit. the Libraries are contained in the corresponding folder as tarballs, which can be extracted by

tar xzvf [file.tar.gz]

and compiled according to the instructions within.
