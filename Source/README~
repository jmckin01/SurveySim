This is the redistributable version of the MCMC code, with the compilation procedure

     ./configure
     make
     sudo make install

on Mac and Linux systems. Note that you must have GSL, CCFits, and cfitsio installed 
for configure to complete; it will tell you the first of these which is missing and 
promptly exit. The Libraries are contained in the corresponding folder as tarballs, 
which can be extracted by

tar xzvf [file.tar.gz]

and compiled according to the instructions within. The tested method by which to 
install these libraries such that all users can access them and the configure script
can find them, is to follow the procedure below:

GSL: make the GSL library, install it in /usr/local and establish references
	./configure
	make
	make check 2>&1
	sudo make install

cfitsio: make the cfitsio library, install it in /usr/local and establish references
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local
	make
	sudo make install

CCFits: make the CCFits library, linking with cfitsio, install it in /usr/local and 
establish references
	./confifgure --with-cfitsio=/usr/local
	make
	sudo make install
Note: If the compilation fails, make sure the ColumnVectorData header file is correct;
it may need to be updated from the CCFits site, which is an easy fix.

Tips for Mac OSX:

Make sure to install command line tools, using XCode for 10.8 and earlier and the 
command
	xcode-select --install
for 10.9. Without these, the ./configure script will not be able to find user
libraries and will fail.
