This file gives information on the required format of input data fits files

===================================================================================

For compatibility with the common fits table format astronomical data is supplied
in, this program expects data input as a FITS table with keywords added to the
headers to facilitate proper input and provide additional information. 

The keyword "FHDR" in the primary header is required if the data is not located 
in the first FITS extension; if located in a higher extension, it should be 
specified here.

The following keywords are required in the header of the table containing the data:
    - F1COL, F2COL, F3COL - name of the column fluxes are located in
    - EF1COL, EF2COL, EF3COL - name of column flux errors are located in
    - F1FILT, F2FILT, F3FILT - name of filter corresponding to observations for
      	      each flux column (should correspond to filter in library)
    - F1MIN, F2MIN, F3MIN - flux limits for each band
Fluxes will be assumed to be in mJy unless otherwise speicified in column format
fields. This does not matter for fluxes, as consistent units given the same colors,
but for calculation of standard error from the mean of flux errors, used to 
generate random flux errors during simulation.

In addition, it is ideal for all bands to have observations (non-zero values),
however the program will automatically exclude those observations with zero values
in case this step is missed as zeros are incompatible with color calculation and
will create overflow when calculating colors.

In this manner, one can use utilities in IDL or python to simply add keywords,
or use the IDL/python interfaces to automatically add these keywords.
