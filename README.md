SurveySim is an MCMC-based code to fit the luminosity function (LF) evolution based on infrared surveys or simulate such surveys by adopting a particular form of the LF evolution. This code was developed by Noah Kurinsky and Anna Sajina primarily as part of Noah Kurinsky's Tufts undergraduate senior thesis. Details on the code structure and usage are found in trunk/manual/UsersGuide.pdf. Please cite Kurinsky et al. 2015 (in prep) whenever making use of SurveySim or parts therein. 

In this main directory:
 
 SurveySim.py: opens a user-friendly GUI interface to SurveySim
 run.sh:       is the quickest, command line, means of running SurveySim based
               on pre-built model files (see trunk/model for examples)

The actual code is contained within the "trunk" directory. Please refer to the README file therein for compilation instructions.
