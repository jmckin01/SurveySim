Project Code for Survey Simulation

Contained in this repository are the main C++ code which runs the MCMC and performs simulation (in Fitting) and the IDL widget, along with IDL code and data used for preliminary analysis. This repository is not an official public release but represents the current Trunk of development, close to the first release. If interested in the function of the main program, please refer to

for more details. If interested in contributing to development, please send me an email. Feel free to fork the repository, with the knowledge that it is not currently tested on clean systems and requires some custom library configuration at the present time.

Compilation: See the README file in Source
