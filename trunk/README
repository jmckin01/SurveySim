SurveySim "fitter" C++ executable installation procedure
Noah Kurinsky, June 10 2014

Below are the compilation instructions for the main executable, which should work
as is for common linux implementations at the time of this writing. Mac users should
refer to the Mac OSX notes before attempting the main compilation, as otherwise
building the libraries will fail.

If any other bugs are found during the compilation process or in use, please post
bug reports to the main github repository: github.com/nkurinsky/SurveySim

===================================================================================
Installation:
(Note: For best (tested) results, use bash when performing the installation)

This is the redistributable version of the MCMC code, with the compilation procedure

     ./configure
     make
     sudo make install

on Mac and Linux systems. Note that you must have GSL, CCFits, and cfitsio installed 
for configure to complete; it will tell you the first of these which is missing and 
promptly exit. The libraries are contained in the corresponding folder (lib_aux) as 
tarballs, which can be extracted by

      tar xzvf [file.tar.gz]

and compiled according to the instructions within. The tested method by which to 
install these libraries such that all users can access them and the configure script
can find them, is to follow the procedure below; you do not have to move the 
directories, just run these commands in your untarred files:

GSL: untar the file and enter it, then type
	./configure
	make
	make check 2>&1
	sudo make install

cfitsio: untar the file and enter it, then type
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local
	make
	sudo make install

CCFits: untar the file and enter it, then type
	./configure --with-cfitsio=/usr/local
	make
	sudo make install
Note: If the compilation fails, make sure the ColumnVectorData header file is correct;
it may need to be updated from the CCFits site, which is an easy fix. Also make sure 
that the directory containing the configure script is called "CCfits", otherwise some
of the header files will not be found and the make command will fail.

====================================================================================

Important Notes for Mac OSX:

Make sure to install command line tools, using XCode for 10.8 and earlier and the 
command
	xcode-select --install
for 10.9. Without these, the ./configure script will not be able to find user
libraries and will fail.

OSX 10.7:
You should use clang and clang++ to compile and link all three libraries, as the llvm
compiler is very buggy and the gsl checks will fail. To do this, add
	 CC=clang CXX=clang++
to your ./configure commands. This is not necessary for the final program but is 
important for make check in gsl.

====================================================================================

Local installation guide:
(For users without root access)

Extract each tarball as normal with the following command

	 tar xzvf [file.tar.gz]

Execute the following three commands begginning in GSL, then moving to cfitsio and
finally in CCFits (cfitsio must be installed before CCFits).

	./configure --prefix=/path/to/SurveySim
	make
	make install 

Note: CCFits will only install if it can find cfitsio. If you get an error that it
cannot, retry with ./configure accordingly

    	 ./configure --prefix=/path/to/SurveySim --with-cfitsio=/path/to/cfitsio

Before attempting the main compilation in SurveySim/trunk, you will need to set
a series of flags. This can be done with the following two commands

  	 export CPPFLAGS='-I/path/to/SurveySim/include'
	 export LDFLAGS='-L/path/to/SurveySim/lib/'

After which execute

      	./configure --prefix=/path/to/SurveySim

Or in one command with ./configure,

      env CPPFLAGS='-I/path/to/SurveySim/include' LDFLAGS='-L/path/to/SurveySim/lib/' ./configure --prefix=/path/to/SurveySim

make will fail unless your current compiler supports c++11, we recommend gcc 4.8.2
or higher for best (tested) results. To complete the installation procedure, execute

   	  make
	  make install
