Packages needed:
         os
	 numpy
	 scipy
	 pyfits (or astropy.io.fits; will need to modify include)
	 matplotlib

Classes:
	ModelFile - instantiate about model.fits file, provides information and i/o functions
	OutputFile - instantiate about output.fits file, provides information and plots
	ObsFile - (unimplemented), will be able to format observations for fits file

Functions:
	(filters.py):
	fill_filters(f_id) - pass three filter IDs (preferably obtained with getFilterID) and returns 6 arrays, 3 wavelengths
			   and three transmission, in the form lam1,t1,lam2,t2,lam3,t3
    	getFilterID(name) - get ID in filter file of specific filter (does not need to be exact, will return first match)
    	getFilterName(fid) - get name of specific filter
    	getFilterIDs(instrument) - get all filters for a given instrument (string matching to names)
